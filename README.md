# SpringBoot
Introduction to the Spring Boot Project.

This project has no other goal than to test the framework and become familiar with it. It will be an incremental project.

For now, I'm using the Spring Boot Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) and creating a guide for reference.

The current dependency applied is "Spring Web." We are connected to an endpoint, launching some POST, GET and DELETE requests.

Moreover, we have defined an hexagonal system folder using the following layers: Presentation (Controllers), Infrastrucutre (Services), Application (Repositories) and Domain (Entities).

Projects:

    - Java version: 22
